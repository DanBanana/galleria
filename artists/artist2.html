                    A renowned Dutch artist during the Golden Age era, Johannes Vermeer made a name for himself from his famous works including the View of Delft and Little Street. Perhaps, these were all because of the fact that he was born in Delft, in the Netherlands. Thus, his inspirations mainly came from where he grew up, which had a major impact on his life and career as a painter. Among his other paintings included The Concert, Women with a Water Jug, and Girl Asleep at the Table. These were his popular masterpieces when his style evolved after his experience in being a part of the Delft Painter's Guild in his hometown.

                    Dedicated to improving his skill, Vermeer decided to register as a master painter with the Delft Guild, in 1653. Although there were insufficient details in history as to the person whom he received his training from, it was recorded that Vermeer had a long-standing friendship with Leonard Bramer. As for the painting style, scholars believe that Rembrandt was one of the influences of Vermeer, as evident in his paintings during the later years.
